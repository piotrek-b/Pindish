Keep your recipes organized with **Pindish**.

Pindish helps you, by preventing you from drowning in the sea of bookmarks with cooking recipes.

Its functionality is simplicity at its finest. After you create an account, you are given an opportunity to parse link of cooking recipe from various internet pages (which will be listed in the near future), and parse it exactly to your personal cookbook. Of course, you can create your own recipes as well.

After confirmation of adding a recipe, you can’t change it anymore. Oh well, maybe a cake tastes better with less sugar? That’s why we created notes. You are free to add as much as you want to your recipe, change their size, color, and put them wherever you like.

Hm, maybe you want to share your recipe to a friend of yours? That is possible with our share recipe button! It creates a link, which you send to anyone who uses Pindish as well, and he puts it the exactly same way as he did with a recipe, which comes from external webpage.

Good luck and have fun using Pindish!
